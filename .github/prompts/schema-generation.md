### Generate SQL Queries

Using the above attached image, i need you to create a very thorough and accurate of all the tables and constraints using postgres sql quaries, i will need that break down inorder to convert it to drizzle ORM syntax later.

### Convert SQL Queries to DrizzleORM Syntax

Now i have bunch of sql schema queries that is responsible for creating the schema and tables for my postgres database, i am using DrizzleORM, so i would like you to convert it to drizzle orm syntax using drizzle Postgres adapter(pg-core), ensure to define the relationships (one-one, one-many, many-many)within each file. I expect you to define each entity in a seperate file, and off course exporting thier relationships as well.

I expect you to export each schema, and reexport it from the main schema file, so it will be the entry point for all schemas
