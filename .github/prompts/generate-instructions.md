Aside from readme, i want you to create "copilot_custom_instructions.md" this is a file as you know used for to provide extra context and instruction to copilot about the project and practices it should follow for code generation.
Make the instruction concise so it can process it quickly, but it should capture the essense of my project , the all the sections and logic of my application, and any useful tip you can suggest based on our discussion so far.

Include things like:
**Maintain Clean, Modular Code**: Keep functions and components small, reusable, and well-documented.
I use axios, always handle errors gracefully
