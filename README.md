### **Core Backend Technologies**

| Technology                                           | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Node.js + Express.js**                             | Fast, scalable REST API backend                         |
| **MongoDB / PostgreSQL**                             | Stores users, materials, study groups, and transactions |
| **Prisma (for PostgreSQL) / Mongoose (for MongoDB)** | ORM/ODM for database interactions                       |
| **JWT Authentication**                               | Secure token-based authentication                       |
| **Zod / Joi**                                        | Schema validation for API requests                      |
| **Nodemailer + Gmail / Brevo (fallback)**            | Email verification and notifications                    |
| **Backblaze B2**                                     | Secure and scalable storage for study materials         |
| **Redis**                                            | Caching for performance improvements                    |
| **BullMQ / Agenda**                                  | Background jobs (e.g., email scheduling, cleanup tasks) |

## **Security Measures üîê**

‚úÖ **JWT Authentication** ‚Äì Secures API endpoints

‚úÖ **Rate Limiting (Express-Rate-Limit)** ‚Äì Prevents abuse (e.g., login attempts)

‚úÖ **CORS Configuration** ‚Äì Restricts access to frontend only

‚úÖ **Environment Variables (.env)** ‚Äì Stores sensitive credentials

‚úÖ **Validation Middleware (Zod/Joi)** ‚Äì Prevents invalid API requests

## **Storage & File Management** üìÇ

### **File Uploads (Backblaze B2)**

- All study materials (PDFs, DOCs) are **stored in Backblaze B2** .
- Users upload files via **presigned URLs** to prevent direct server overload.
- Moderators review flagged files before deletion.

---

## **Email Notifications (Verification & Alerts) üìß**

- **Primary Provider:** Nodemailer (Gmail)
- **Fallback Provider:** Brevo (when Gmail limits are reached)
- **Triggers:**
  - Email verification
  - Moderator notifications
  - Withdrawal processing alerts

---

## **Background Jobs & Optimization ‚ö°**

- **Redis & BullMQ** ‚Äì Used for handling scheduled tasks (e.g., auto-expiring inactive study groups).
- **Caching with Redis** ‚Äì Frequently accessed data (e.g., top study materials) is cached for fast retrieval.

## **Deployment & CI/CD üöÄ**

- **Hosting:** Railway, Render, or DigitalOcean
- **Database:** Managed PostgreSQL (Supabase / PlanetScale)
- **Storage:** Backblaze B2
